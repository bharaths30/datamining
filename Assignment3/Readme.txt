Instructions

To run Task 1

1. Copy all the videos from each group into the "Data/Videos/" folder. (These videos were not copied initially due to their total size)
2. Set the Assignment3 folder as the current folder in MATLAB.
3. Run Assignment1_Task1

P.S - Since the parsed input is needed to be written into a file, the time taken for execution is high.

1. Set the Assignment3 folder as the current folder in MATLAB.
2. Run Assignment1_Task2andTask3

P.S - Kindly ensure that the folders "Task2PlotImages" and "Task3PlotImages" are created in the current folder i.e Assignment3/ (Plots generated from the tasks are saved into these folders).
